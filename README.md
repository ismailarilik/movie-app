# Movie App

This is a movie app built with Next.js. The app displays a list of popular movies on the home page and allows users to search for movies by title. The app allows users to view information about each movie by clicking on a movie to go to its details page.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and change the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/biskendr/movie-app
cd movie-app
```

2. Copy the example environment file. You'll need to add your TMDB API key to this file:

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

3. Then, install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
